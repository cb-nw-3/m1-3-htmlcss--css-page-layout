 /* block-level elements like div default to being 100% of the available space. 
 So .row fills the entire space made available by body, which is the entire window.
  When the window size changes, .row shrinks (since it's 100% of a smaller window), 
  and each .column shrinks to take up 1/3rd of that space. 
  The image takes up 100% of that column */
